#Overview
In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict whether they performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways (classe). 

The data link is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

This write up document describes the analysis. 

#Getting and cleaning data
The dataset was split in a training (60%) and testing (40%) set. Columns with a significant number (96%) of Missing values (NA) were removed and columns with significant Near-zero-values. Additionally, the X column was identified as a confounding variable and removed. The classes of the training and test sets were unified.
```{r, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
library(caret)
set.seed(125)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=data$classe, p=.6, list=F)
training <- data[inTrain,]
testing <- data[-inTrain,]

testCases <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
dim(training); dim(testing)
```

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# identifying and removing colums where NA values account for 96%
colNA <- colMeans(is.na(training))
training2<- training[, colNA < .96]
testing2<- testing[, colNA < .96]
testCases2 <- testCases[, colNA < .96]
#removing column 1 "X" which is a confounding variable 
training2 <- training2[, -1]
testing2 <- testing2[, -1]
testCases2 <- testCases2[,-1]
```

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(caret)
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training2)
training3 <- training2[,-nzv]; 
testing3 <- testing2[,-nzv]; 
testCases3 <- testCases2[,-nzv]
```

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
classTR <- class(training3)
class(testing3) <- classTR
class(testCases3) <- classTR
```

##Exploratory Data Analysis
The remaining data (58 variables) was reviewed with functions dim, str, summary. The distribution of the outcome variable was reviewed and featurePlots of the 58 variables were run.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
(library(lattice))
histogram(testing3$classe)
```

##Variable Importance and model selection
Relative importance is assessed using varImp function before and after NZV were removed. NZV proved to have little impact.
```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE }
RocImp_inclNZV <- filterVarImp(x=training2[, -ncol(training2)], y=training2$classe)
RocImp_exclNZV <- filterVarImp(x=training3[, -ncol(training3)], y=training3$classe)
summary(RocImp_exclNZV)
```

Three model were selected (with the accuracy statistic from the confusionMatrix alongside):
1. with all 58 remaining variables (99.99% accuracy)
2. included variables with importance > 70% (65% accuracy)
3. variables with importance > 60% (92.7% accuracy)

The train function is used to evaluate, using 5 fold resampling, the effect of model tuning paramters on performance, choose the "optimal" model across these parameters and estimate model performance from a training set.
A gradient boosting machine (GBM) model was used with three main tuning parameters:
- number of iterations set to (1:30)*50
- complexity of the tree set through the interaction.depth parameter at (2, 5, 13)
- learning rate: how quickly the algorithm adapts, called shrikage (set at 0.1)
- the minimum number of training set samples in a node to commence splitting (n. minobsinnode=10)

To improve processing speed parallel processing options were used to run the model. The confusion matrix on the testing set is below. 

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE }
set.seed(125)
library(doMC)
registerDoMC(cores=5)
##All subsequent models are then run in parallel
gbmGrid <- expand.grid(interaction.depth=c(2,5,13), n.trees=c(1:30)*50, shrinkage=.01, n.minobsinnode=10)
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5)
modelClass <- train(classe ~ ., data=training3, method="gbm",trControl=fitControl, verbose=FALSE, tuneGrid=gbmGrid, preProc=c("pca"))
cM <- confusionMatrix(training3$classe, predict(modelClass, training3[,-58]))
```
The confusionMatrix below shows the results compared to the actual classe in the training set.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cM
```

The model was run on the testing set and the confusion Matrix of model, which is printed below, created.
The accuracy of the model on the testing data set is 97.54%. This compares to a 99.99% accuracy on the testing set. The difference is the out of sample error which is always higher than the in sample error (due to overfitting of the model.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
predClass <- predict(modelClass, testing3[,-58])
cMPred <- confusionMatrix(testing3$classe, predClass)
cMPred
```
A plots below examine the relationship between the estimates of performance and the tuning parameters.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
trellis.par.set(caretTheme())
plot(modelClass)

plot(modelClass, metric = "Kappa", plotType = "level", scales = list(x = list(rot = 90)))
```

The model was used to predict the classe of the 20 test cases which were submitted to Coursera.
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
answers <- predict(modelClass, testCases3[,-58])
answers
```
This resulted in 19 correct answers and 1 error. Based on these results degree of impurity is measured as follows:
Misclassification: `r 1/20`; 
Gini: `r 1- ((1/20)^2 +(19/20)^2)`; and 
No Information Rate: `r -(1/20*log2(1/20)+19/20*log2(19/20))`.
